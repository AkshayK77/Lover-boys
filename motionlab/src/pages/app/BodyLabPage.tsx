      summary: 'Magnesium is required for the enzymes that actually incorporate amino acids into new muscle.',
      whyItMatters: 'Muscle protein synthesis is enzyme-driven, and many of those enzymes require magnesium as a co-factor. Without adequate magnesium, amino acids are absorbed but the molecular machinery to build them into new muscle is impaired. Magnesium also reduces cortisol, a catabolic hormone that directly breaks down muscle protein.',
      deficiency: 'High protein intake with low magnesium may blunt recovery due to impaired synthesis enzyme activity.',
      timing: 'Ensure magnesium intake is adequate throughout the day; magnesium before bed supports overnight protein synthesis.',

      summary: 'B vitamins are the metabolic keys that unlock carbohydrate energy.',
      whyItMatters: 'Carbohydrates cannot be converted to ATP without B vitamins as enzymatic co-factors. Thiamine (B1) initiates carbohydrate catabolism; riboflavin (B2) and niacin (B3) shuttle electrons through the electron transport chain; B6 enables glycogen breakdown during high-intensity work. A high-carb diet without adequate B vitamins creates energy bottlenecks despite sufficient fuel.',
      deficiency: 'High carb intake with low B vitamins leads to incomplete energy extraction and persistent fatigue despite eating enough.',
      timing: 'B vitamins are water-soluble and not stored — spread intake throughout the day especially around carb-rich meals.',
